-- brandbond is a social media app that finds, connects and matches romantic dates, finds friends, communities and fan-clubs with common favorites, similar choices, habits, interests & hobbies. so, it finds you dates as well as friends and groups based on your common similar choices in - fav singers, fav songs, fav music categories, fav music composers, fav songwriters, fav music bands, fav idols, fav singer groups, fav movies, fav movie categories, fav TV series, fav TV series categories, fav books, fav book categories, fav cartoons, fav comics, fav actors, fav sports, fav athletes, fav travel destinations, fav travel destination categories, fav food/cuisine, fav food/cuisine categories, fav shopping brands, fav tech gadgets, fav hobbies, fav interests, fav habits, fav animals etc. 

-- we need to create an entire user journey for this idea. what will it be? from start to end. what will its vital features be for users to get excited, explore and keep coming back to use the app as an addiction? list them out with descriptions. 

--the login and registration pages havent been designed fully. design them completely from a finding friends as well as finding dates perspective. they are currently glitching when we type in the data. and make sure they are connected to supabase database through sql schema. keep updating the sql schema as u design the frontend logic. 

-- let's start with only the registration form first.

the registration form should be as follows -
1. step 0 - what part of BrandBond do you want to explore? Find Dates OR Find Friends & Fan-Clubs & Communities? (according to this selection, the further form filling fields will open. if they click on both, all the fields will open. if they click on dating, the dating related fields will be visible, otherwise will be hidden.) 
2. step 1 - name, username, password, confirm password
2. step 2 - dob, age (auto calculated), gender, location
4. step 3 - spoken languages, preferred age gap (for dating match), gender preference (for dating match), distance of the date from your location (for dating match)
5. step 4 - 1 all time favorite from each category selection - music category, song, singer, singer groups, singer idols, music bands, movie, movie category, tv series, tv series category, book, book category, cartoon, travel destination, travel destination category, food/cuisine, food/cuisine category, sport, athlete, video game, tech gadget, shopping brand, hobby/interest, habit. (Design an algorithm to collect all these all time favorites, and craft a beautiful poetic bio using all the all time fav keywords in a paragraph, that will ultimately be the about description of the user. as soon as the user inputs all of these and clicks on next, an about paragraph will be auto generated based on your all time favorites combination in a poetic form). (At the same time, the 1 all time favorite from each category will also get added to your friendship as well as dating profile. )
6. step 5- upload photos (6). These will be added to your dating profile gallery as well as your friendship profile posts. 

-- implement the UI, frontend logic, backend logic, algorithms, entire database schema, and everything else needed to make this function. let's take it slow, step by step. cover the registration form and its design only.
