BrandBond is not just a dating app or a typical social media app, it's a comprehensive social discovery ecosystem. Let me think through what the post-registration experience should look like:

##    **Main Dashboard (Home Base)**
This would be the central hub where users land after registration. Think of it as their "social command center":

**Key Elements:**
- **Quick Stats**: "You have 47% compatibility with 23 people nearby"

- **Recent Activity**: "Sarah from Mumbai updated her profile", "New Marvel fans joined your community"
- **Quick Actions**: "Find Friends", "Discover Communities", "Plan a Meetup"

##    **Discovery Feed (The Main Attraction)**
This is where the magic happens - the addictive swiping experience:

**Card Design:**
- **Top Section**: Profile photo + name + age + location
- **Middle Section**: "We think you'll click because..." with 2-3 highlighted shared interests
- **Bottom Section**: Compatibility percentage + quick action buttons
- **Swipe Actions**: Right (like), Left (pass), Up (super like), Down (maybe later)

**Smart Filtering:**
- Relationship intent (dating/friendship/community)

--- now, we will have to combine and bring together all of these pieces mentioned above, and make a detailed list of pages, the features that will need to be included in these pages, and the algorithms that will be needed to automate these features and make them seamless. Let's brainstorm about this in our chat, before coding anything. Use your emotional intelligence and tell me, in a language that even a layman can understand.
